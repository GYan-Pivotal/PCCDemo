# Pivotal Cloud Cache Look-aside Demo

Welcome to the PCCDemo Application. This demo repository is solely focused on simple examples of a look-aside cache implementation.
The structure of this repo is that there are multiple branches that represent different look-aside implementations. 

e.g 
* Look-aside using GemFire API 
* look-aside using [Spring Data Geode](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-geode) 
* look-aside using [Spring Boot Data Geode](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode)

All of these examples have been tested against [Pivotal Cloud Cache](https://pivotal.io/pivotal-cloud-cache).

These examples are merely simple starting points to prove out complexity or simplicity of each approach.
These examples are NOT tutorials on each product used.
